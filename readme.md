## What is INSTANT HOST?

INSTANT HOST is a **hostel discovery and booking platform** for university students.
It lets students find hostels near their campus, view available rooms, make
booking requests, and pay — all through a REST API.

There are **three user roles**:

| Role | What they can do |
|------|-----------------|
| **STUDENT** | Browse hostels, book rooms, make payments, leave reviews |
| **CUSTODIAN** | List and manage hostels & rooms, approve / decline bookings |
| **ADMIN** | Manage all users and view platform-wide data |

---

## What You Will Learn

By reading and extending this codebase you will understand:

- **REST API design** — resources, HTTP verbs, status codes
- **Express.js** — routing, middleware, error handling
- **MySQL with mysql2** — connection pools, parameterised queries, JOINs
- **Authentication** — password hashing with bcryptjs, JWT creation & verification
- **Authorisation** — role-based access control (RBAC) with middleware
- **Environment variables** — keeping secrets out of source code with dotenv
- **Database relationships** — one-to-many and many-to-many associations
- **JSON columns** — storing structured data (amenities, photos) in MySQL
- **Modular code structure** — models → controllers → routes separation

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Minimum version | Install guide |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Node.js** | v18 | https://nodejs.org |
| **npm** | v9 (comes with Node) | — |
| **MySQL** | v8 | https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ |
| **Git** | any | https://git-scm.com |
| **Postman** *(optional)* | any | https://www.postman.com |

Verify your installations:

```bash
node --version    # should print v18.x.x or higher
npm --version     # should print 9.x.x or higher
mysql --version   # should print 8.x.x
```

---

## Setup — Step by Step

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/musasizi/instant_host.git
cd instant_host/instant_host_api
```

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This reads `package.json` and downloads all libraries into the `node_modules/`
folder. You should see a `node_modules/` directory appear.

### Step 3 — Create the MySQL database

Log in to MySQL and create an empty database. The seed script will create all
the tables for you in the next step.

```bash
# Start the MySQL CLI (enter your root password when prompted)
mysql -u root -p
```

```sql
-- Inside the MySQL shell:
CREATE DATABASE instant_host_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
EXIT;
```

> **What is CHARACTER SET utf8mb4?** It supports all Unicode characters,
> including emojis. Always use it for new projects.

### Step 4 — Create your `.env` file

Create a file called `.env` in the `instant_host_api/` directory. This file holds
secret values that must NOT be committed to Git.

```bash
# copy the example
cp .env.example .env    # if an example exists, otherwise create it manually
```

Or create it manually (see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
section for all the values you need).

### Step 5 — Seed the database

This command runs `scripts/seed.js`, which:
1. Drops any existing tables
2. Re-creates them with the correct schema
3. Inserts sample users, hostels, rooms, bookings, payments, and reviews

```bash
npm run seed
```

Expected output:
```
Connected to database. Running INSTANT HOST seed...

✔  Dropped existing tables
✔  Table: users
✔  Table: hostels
✔  Table: rooms
✔  Table: bookings
✔  Table: payments
✔  Table: reviews
✔  Seeded: 6 users
✔  Seeded: 4 hostels + rooms
✔  Seeded: bookings, payments, reviews
Seed complete!
```

### Step 6 — Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

Nodemon starts the server and watches for file changes. Every time you save a
`.js` file it automatically restarts — no need to stop and re-run manually.

You should see:
```
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
MySQL connected
Server running on port 3000
```

### Step 7 — Verify it works

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

Expected response:
```json
{ "message": "INSTANT HOST API is running 🏠", "status": "ok" }
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in `instant_host_api/`. **Never commit this file to Git**
— it is already listed in `.gitignore`.

```dotenv
# ── Database ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DB_HOST=localhost          # MySQL host (use 'localhost' for local dev)

DB_USER=root               # MySQL username
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword   # MySQL password — CHANGE THIS!
DB_DATABASE=instant_host_db     # Database name you created in Step 3

# ── Server ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PORT=3000                  # Port the API listens on

# ── JSON Web Tokens ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Anyone with this string can forge tokens — keep it secret!
# Generate one with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_a_long_random_secret_string

# ── Email (optional — needed for verify-email / forgot-password flows) ────────

## Testing with cURL / Postman

### Login and save the token

```bash
# 1. Login as a student
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@student.com","password":"password123"}'
```

Copy the `token` value from the response. In the examples below replace
`<TOKEN>` with that value.

### Browse hostels (public — no token needed)

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hostels
```

### Get rooms for hostel 1 (public)

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hostels/1/rooms
```

### Create a booking (requires STUDENT token)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"room_id":1,"check_in_date":"2026-08-01","check_out_date":"2027-01-31"}'
```

### Approve a booking (requires CUSTODIAN token)

```bash
# First login as a custodian
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@instanthost.com","password":"password123"}'

# Then approve booking with id=1
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <CUSTODIAN_TOKEN>"
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### Why do we use a connection pool?

A single database connection can only run one query at a time. If two users
send requests simultaneously, the second request has to wait for the first to
finish. A **connection pool** maintains multiple open connections and hands
them out as needed — so concurrent requests run in parallel.

### What is a JWT and why does it expire?

A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a signed, self-contained string that proves who
you are. The server signs it with `JWT_SECRET` when you log in. On every
protected request your browser sends it back in the `Authorization` header.
The server verifies the signature — no database lookup needed.

Tokens expire (default 24 h) so a stolen token cannot be used forever.

### Why hash passwords instead of storing them plain?

If the database were ever breached, plain-text passwords would expose all
users. **bcryptjs** runs a slow one-way hashing algorithm. Even if an attacker
gets the hash they cannot reverse it — they would have to guess billions of
combinations.

### Why separate models from controllers?

- **Models** only talk to the database. Swap MySQL for PostgreSQL and you only
  change the model files.
- **Controllers** contain business logic (validate input, decide what to do).
  They call models but never write SQL directly.
- This separation makes each layer independently testable and maintainable.

### Why are `amenities` and `photos` stored as JSON?

Every hostel has a different number of amenities. Storing them in a separate
table would require a JOIN for every hostel query. MySQL 8 supports native
JSON columns, so we store them as arrays directly in the `hostels` row.
`mysql2` automatically parses them back into JavaScript arrays when you read
the data — no `JSON.parse()` needed.

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests live in the `tests/` folder and use **Jest**.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher).
- Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
- Install a REST client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or use `curl` for testing.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/musasizi/express-mysql-app.git
cd express-mysql-app
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Set Up the Database**
1. Log in to MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. Create the database and tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE express_auth;
   USE express_auth;

   CREATE TABLE users (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   CREATE TABLE chapters (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     description TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   CREATE TABLE user_chapters (
     user_id INT,
     chapter_id INT,
     PRIMARY KEY (user_id, chapter_id),
     FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     FOREIGN KEY (chapter_id) REFERENCES chapters(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

### **5. Configure Environment Variables**
